-Find Elements
Locator Techniques :

Xpath
ID
ClassName
Name
linkText
CssSelector
Partial link text

1. every object may not have ID or className. Thats when XPath and CSS are preferred
2. IF id is alpha numeric- it will keep changing everytime u refresh page
3. Confirm link object with anchor tag <a> - use linkText in this case
4. COMPUND CLASS cannot be accepted. Class Should NOT have spaces - thats when we use XPath and CSS
5. if there ae multiple object with same identifier example class="inputtext" 
- in this case if we write findElement code, it will identify first element from top left.
6. You can generate XPath from browser developer tools. But those are not 100% reliable. - right click on the line of code, copy --> xpath- FIREFOX DOESNOT GIVE GOOD XPATH ON RIGHT CLICK. use chrome to get the xpath
7. for finding css selector, CHROME does NOT  help in finding css selector on right click. on chrome, u fond it on toolbar. USE FIREFOX browser to get the CSS SElctor
7. you should be able to generate own XPath or CSS by seeing the html code on your own
8. java does NOT accept "" inside "" u can have single quote inside double quote.
8. XPath can be defined in a number of ways
9. to validate an x path or css on any browser:
go to console tab
For XPath: type $x("")--- and then ur path inside this in single quote.
When you hit enter, it console window will give a result. putting ur mouse over that result will highlight that object on the browser
For CSS: type $("")--- and then ur path inside this in single quote.
When you hit enter, it console window will give a result. putting ur mouse over that result will highlight that object on the browser

10. Following are ACTIONS: 
getText()
.click();
.sendKeys("test");
