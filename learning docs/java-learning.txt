- the control and execution will always start from main method
- public static void main-- is the heart of java
- class is the file in which you will write java code
- java class files are used to write the java code
- execution is restricted to main block

public class Basic1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
	System.out.println("my first code");

	}

}

2. Concatenation operator
to get a string and a variable together, java uses concatenation opertator + to join them
int x = 2;
int y = 3;
int z = x + y;
System.out.println("Sum is" + z);


3. to reuse a set of code accross differnet test scripts, java u can create objects

OOPS SECTTION OF JAVA
1. How to define reusable objects- How to define object in another class and call them
i) We first create an object
e.g. ReusableBlock

public class ReusableBlock {

public void ValidateHeader()
{
	System.out.println("Header links Validate");
}

}

ii) Then we go to our page with the following syntax
e.g basics1

public class Basic1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
System.out.println("I navigated to Home Page");

// add 2 and 3 output 5
ReusableBlock r = new ReusableBlock();
r.ValidateHeader();
	}


In above code--- new is a memory allocation operator
you define a new opbject r and then u call the method defined in reusable object

}
